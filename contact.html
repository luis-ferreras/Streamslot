  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <p><strong>How do I save my board data?</strong></p>
  <p>StreamSlot automatically saves all your data to your browser's local storage. Your teams, buyers, and settings persist between sessions. You can also export backups from the Export tab.</p>

  <p><strong>Can I use StreamSlot on multiple devices?</strong></p>
  <p>Yes! Use the Export tab to download your board data as a backup file, then import it on another device. Your data stays private and never touches our servers.</p>

  <p><strong>Is StreamSlot really free?</strong></p>
  <p>Yes, StreamSlot is 100% free to use with no hidden fees, subscriptions, or premium tiers. It's an open-source project built for the card breaking community.</p>

  <p><strong>How do I add StreamSlot to OBS?</strong></p>
  <p>Add a Browser Source in OBS pointing to streamslot.app. Enable the green screen background in the Scene tab, then use a Chroma Key filter in OBS to make the background transparent.</p>

  <p><strong>My data disappeared. What happened?</strong></p>
  <p>Data is stored in your browser's local storage. Clearing browser data, using private/incognito mode, or switching browsers will result in a fresh start. Always export backups regularly from the Export tab.</p>
